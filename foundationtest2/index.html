          <h4>Singularity Powered</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">Our Deep Space Biscuits are powered by the neutrino matter found in the very center of black holes and neutron stars. We broke so many laws of physics to get you these incredible biscuits. In fact, the very production of these biscuits meant that every physics and chemistry textbook had to be rewritten, which means that they just got another excuse to publish another $1,000 edition.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">You won't believe how hard-working our Deep Space Biscuits are. You think drones powered by general intelligence AI are powerful? You haven't seen shit. These biscuits are incredible. Want to digest the universe? Done. Want to crush the minds of your mortal enemies? Easy! Or how about reconstructing a universal simulation of that one time that Timmy fucked up building that shed? We got your back.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">Ever wonder why only cats are allowed to get high on catnip? Well, look no further! Our Deep Space Biscuits are certified to be completely safe for all kinds of doggos!<sup>1</sup> If you care for your dog's well-being, you'll let them get high with our biscuits. To explain in words what you dog will experience just doesn't do it justice. It's like... LSD for dogs, but times one million. With no bad trips, because dogs can't have bad trips.</p>

          <blockquote>The moment I opened the titanium-clad package, I knew that I had stumbled upon something special. The biscuit completely annihilated any trace of matter in my room and opened up an entirely new antimatter dimension. I'm made entirely of antimatter now, which makes it so much easier for me to avoid my neighbors.
